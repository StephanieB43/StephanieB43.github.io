            <p><em>History of Carnival </em><br> In 1955, various clubs and districts were brought together for the first public Aruba Carnival with the first official Carnival queen. The traditional Grand Parades were organized in 1957. On November 11, 1966 (11/11/66), at 11:11 a.m., Stichting Arubaanse Carnaval, Carnivalâ€™s organizing body, was founded. Each year, the Carnival season officially begins at this precise moment. Ever since 1981, Tivoli has produced the Lighting Parade, a twinkling nighttime extravaganza.</p>
